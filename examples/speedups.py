# Velum can be installed as `pip install velum[speedups]`.
# Doing so installs a couple extra dependencies that can considerably improve
# the performance of your bot. This example will go over what to do to actually
# opt into all the speedup features.

import asyncio

import uvloop

import velum

# First and foremost, we will use orjson instead of the default json library.
# This can easily achieved with a helper function provided by Velum.
# You don't have to manually call this as the library will try to use orjson 
# first, if it's installed locally.
# Note that this will raise an `ImportError` if orjson is not installed.

# velum.set_json_impl(impl=velum.JSONImpl.ORJSON)


# Next, and probably the most impactful, is uvloop. This only works on
# Unix, and is therefore not installed with speedups if you are on a
# different platform.

uvloop.install()


# Finally, we instantiate and run a bot as per usual.
